# Reflection
> This was a 4 week long project built during our thesis module at RBK Bootkamp of Software. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.Originally we wanted to build a website that allowed users to order bread and bakery's products in the Quarintine time.
> One of the main challenges we ran into was Authentication. This lead us to spend a few days on a research about jwt.
